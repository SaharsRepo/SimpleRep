# SimpleRep
Hi,

This is a simple program I wrote for work just to enable the user to read specific lines in an automatically generated text file.

This by no means an example on how to scribble a fetch search and read program.

It takes a user input, searches for the name of the file provided by the user 
and prints only the relevant lines thats needed for him/her, this project was terminated early due to our manager,
asking for a professional team to write the program instead.
